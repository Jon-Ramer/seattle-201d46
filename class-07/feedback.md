What we Liked

- Teachers, and TA's help you find the solution rather than just the outcome
- Breaking the code down in code review and demos
  - Still struggling to break down my own work into smaller steps
- Seeing things work (or not work) real-time is so good.
- Code review has definitely been the most beneficial part of each day

What we could improve

- 101 course that gives people more terminal practice would be hugely beneficial 
- I'm going to try and make all the homework up.
- the fire alarm drill
- I need to execute better time management. 
- focus probably should have been 95% on the coding aspect.
- A preparing to code intro course that focuses on how to use your computer, especially to really get to know the terminal
- I feel weak about my skills coming into the course compared to others who have coded before
