# Feedback week 2

## Things that went well

- Felt motivated by seeing the code density in some of the code reviews
- I started to spend more time reviewing things that were covered day of even though I was behind in the code. This actually helped reinforce my learning and it made it much easier to tackle things when I got to them
- I learn better by actually doing it a couple of times,rather than listening
- The Css
- The Js
- Pair Programming

## Things to Improve upon

- maybe make more hours in a day
- code review of someone's code that is not broken means we don't actually go into why the code works
- At times TA's have a hard time helping with problems and they take a long time to answer a question.
- I would digest the material better over a longer course
- instructional booklet or handout with the class curriculum
- The Css
- The Js
- Ta Stability
